### **Make a customize blog.**

**Here are something you can use :**

1. Change a nav backgound color
2. Change a footer backgound color
3. Type your own motto in the title

First I use input in the nav. The user can choose color then change the backgound.
Furthermore, write a addEventListener in the script. When the user click backgound then the color will change.
